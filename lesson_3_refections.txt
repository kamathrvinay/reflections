Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
R. Remote repos are useful when collaborating with people who use their own computers and setups. Also useful as a backup source. 

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
R. You might not want all the changes provided by collaborators to be pulled automatically into your local repo. You might need control on what to pull and when.
