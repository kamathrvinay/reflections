What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you have git add meta data and track changes to this repository.
Initailizing the repository is needed so that git can track the changes in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working dir has all the changes done since the previous commit. Staging has only those changes which the author thinks should belong into the next commit - it is a holding area for changes that need to go into the next commit. 
Staging lets us group changes that belong into the same commit. It helps in logically separating the changes.
