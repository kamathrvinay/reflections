Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
R. Remote repos are useful when collaborating with people who use their own computers and setups. Also useful as a backup source. 

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
R. You might not want all the changes provided by collaborators to be pulled automatically into your local repo. You might need control on what to pull and when.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
R. Fork is used to remote clone a repo - it happens on github. Cloning a repo would mean making a copy of any repo - this can be done on remote repos or local repos. Branching is used to keep experimental commits separate from a master branch (which possibly contains production code).
